## Introduction
When it comes to investment strategies for the everyday user, it can quickly become very cumbersome to cut
through the noise. Often, you need an investment advisor with years of experience, who will end up taking
a hefty cut of your investment. For those more financially savvy, very complicated, custom excel spread-
sheets become the norm to assess information based on real-time data.

We've created a service which simplifies certain aspects of the process. TraderSquare gives the user the
functionality to filter stocks based on their own preferences, and order stocks based on different financial
criterea, all without even logging in. Currently, these two services are limited to stocks in the S&P 500, but
users can also find current financial data for any stock provided by the Intrinio API and store that information
in their TraderSquare account.
